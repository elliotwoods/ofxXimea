# ofxXimea

An addon for interfacing with Ximea cameras (e.g. xiQ USB 3.0 cameras) from openFrameworks.

Should work for:
* Windows
* OSX (some performance issues with underlying drivers, needs 64bit oF).
* Linux (totally untested, but the Ximea API is the same so should work).

## Installation

### Windows

### OSX
1. Download the [Ximea OSX software package](http://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/XIMEA_OSX_Software_Package).
2. Open the DMG file
3. Copy the “m3api.framework” folder to your Frameworks folder.
4. Wait for Ximea 32bit support (or 64bit openFrameworks support).

## License
The code here is under the MIT license (as per openFrameworks).
